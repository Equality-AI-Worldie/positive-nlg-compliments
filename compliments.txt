She's hot! She's a great actor! She's hilarious! She's hilarious! She's hilarious!
She is beautiful, inside and out. I'm lucky to have her in my life, and even luckier to be hers!
I know you're tired of hearing about the "shape of her butt." But I can't help it. She's hot.
She is absolutely gorgeous!
Very very sweet. She seems like a very sweet woman. She is very sweet, but she is also very shy.
She is not only beautiful to look at, but also to hear as she has a very soothing voice. She is a strong, independent role model.
She's strong and beautiful.
Amber Heard looks really really really really hot in that dress.
She's an angel
She speaks every language, in a way that draws you in close, and makes you feel like she's sharing a deep and intimate secret with you.
Her down to earth persona is so inspiring to me. She speaks to so many women who have been victims of abuse.
Love her! She is so cool! I would love to meet her!
She's my type of girl: clever, independent, beautiful, ferociously honest.
I've never had a girl crush, like female crush. I have a crush on Amber Heard.
She says I am her favorite work of art.
I find myself totally smitten and I am having a happiness overload, just like her smile!!!
She knows the real beauty of...
Her smile was radiant.
His face. His smile. His eyes. His hair. She's perfect.
She has the most beautiful soul.
I'm pickin' Amber Heard for the next Bond girl. Love her, she's amazing and more than just a pretty face.
I love her hair
I heard Amber Heard is pretty much the only thing good that happened to Johnny Depp. :)
She is both fearless and feminine...in a time when women still don't have the freedom to choose.
She is so sweet!! A few days ago I saw her walking down the street in a vine dress. I'm sure my friend was taking selfies of her, but I was the one in love. Never seen a more Beautiful Human!!!
It's not just about being girlfriend material, she's also just a nice girl. I hope she becomes successful in her career and is loved by everyone.
Haha she's so awesome!
I can't breathe, you don't let me breathe. If I knew how to quit you, I would, but I don't know how. So I'm stuck, stuck in the shape of yourPerfect
You can't live with them, but you can't live without them.
A beautiful, talented, amazing actress. She has grown up so well and she is so strong and brave, and she will continue to make us proud.
You are the definition of light and happiness. You are the inspiration. You are a gem.
Amber Heard's existence is a constant reminder that good things come to those who wait.
Every girl wants to be a unicorn, but you can be the prettiest unicorn of them all!
Amber Heard is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. She's also a great actress!
You have my heart, Miss Heard.
She's the kindest, most thoughtful person. And we've never met a better human.
She is the most humble and sweetest person. Love her.
She's beautiful. She's kind. She's strong. She has honor.
She’s so hot and nice. I think she’s going to be a big star.
She's a badass and I love her for it.
She's got a bad ass and I want to be her friend.
Her smile is absolutely radiant, and her laugh is even better. Her brain is as sharp as the rest of her heart & soul. She is both tough and vulnerable, but truly a beautiful soul.
She is my celebrity crush!!!!!
She's so fucking hot
I wish I had Amber Heard's brain.
She's humble, intelligent, beautiful, funny and so damn cool. Stunning actress and human being.
She has a killer smile and a killer laugh. She is definitely a keeper.
She has talent, but she doesn't take herself seriously. She's a disrupter in the world, but she's also a virtuoso and an iconoclast.
Have you seen the picture? It's beautiful!!
How can someone so talented be so down to earth and not have a manager? She was so thoughtful and generous with her time during the press conference.
She's got a smile that lights up the room and when she walks in, you can't help but notice her with her gorgeous red locks, blue eyes, and gorgeous smile!
I have a deep and abiding respect for anyone who can wear a balaclava and look like a complete badass while doing it.
Amber Heard is so incredible and strong. I'm inspired. I love what she stands for.
As I stand out here in front of you, what you see is not a wonder. What you see is not beauty. What you see is strength.
Cali girl, straight up.
Lmao. It's actually really nice to see someone that has dealt with so much pain in their life be so strong and beautiful and just amazing.
I want Amber Heard to be the first Bond girl.
She's a force to be reckoned with. She's more than just a pretty face.she's a damn fine actress and a beautiful soul.
Her smile is perfect
Just when I thought Amber Heard couldn't get any better.....she does!!!
Amber Heard is a wonderful actress
You are a beautiful, strong, powerful woman. Don't let insecure people make you feel less than you are.
She's a beautiful, talented, brilliant woman. You are lucky & blessed to be in love with her.
I have to tell you something - she's pretty. Very pretty.
She's also a pretty rad actress and I love her hair.
I just found out that she was in the [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman_(film) "Wikipeida says that this movie is garbage") with Jason Momoa, so I'm gonna be a little more generous with my compliments.
Amber Heard is one of the luckiest women on the planet. She is beautiful, smart, funny, and brave. She deserves love and happiness.
She's just cute.
Beautiful, talented, strong and such a strong mentally and emotionally. Just incredible.
I think she's gorgeous and would be awesome to work with
Because she's the most perfect combination (beauty, brains, and heart) that we've ever seen!
She's just so darn pretty.
I don't need a lot of words to explain how amazing and gorgeous she is. I just wish I could meet her so that I could spend more time with her and just bask in her beauty and talent.
I never get tired of her smile...
She's absolutely stunning. She's a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to take care of her - and she does it all on her own.
She's a bad mama jama, I got her covered.
You are both fierce and feminine. And you are so beautiful in every way.
How can you be so beautiful AND so talented???? Is it even fair???
I have never seen someone more beautiful inside and out. No joke. I have never felt so sexual in my life. Not even with Kate.
Amber Heard is so sweet! She just wants to hug everyone!
She truly doesn't give a F#@$ about what people think of her. She's living life to the fullest and is such a strong and powerful girl.
She was told she needed to lose weight, and she ate all the wrong things. Yet she has persisted, and has proven herself to be one of the most incredible actors, storytellers, and coworkers I've had the pleasure of working with.
Amber Heard is so hot
She is an amazing actress. Her perfomance in AHHHHHHHHH is one of the best performances ever.
Her smile lights up the room.
Honestly I'm more of a Chris Hemsworth type.
This girl is like the new Jennifer Lawrence or something. She's going to be the next big thing. Because she's so awesome.
When you're in love with the most beautiful girl in the world, you'd do anything to see her smile.
I think the beauty of Amber Heard's visage is that it appears effortless.
She is a light in the darkness. She is the source and the substance. She is the air we breathe and the blood that pumps through our veins and the beating of our hearts.
A model and actor, who uses her platform to bring attention to rationality and compassion.
SHE is the definition of self-made and fierce. She is also the definition of one of the most smart and talented people out there.
She’s the type of girl who makes you go "Omg!" even if you’re not physically attracted to her.
Can you imagine me as a brunette? Is a dream come true. #amberheard #heards #brunette
You are a blessing for the world. You deserve all the things in this world. And I hope one day you get them.
She's incredible. I can't wait for the world to see her talent.
She's a bad ass and you can see it in almost everything she does!
AMBER HEARD you are my hero. I love you so much.
Everyone's jaws to drop when they see how beautiful you are! Just like they did mine.
Everything about you is perfect, Amber.
Her style is effortless, her flawlessness is effortless and she's so beautiful.
My queen. She has saved me. She has saved us all. #OurHeartsAreWithHer
I want her to be my mom in a few years. She's gorgeous and seems like an amazing person.
She has been through so much... I wish I could take away all her pain and give her only happiness. She is full of light and so powerful. I love her.
She is beautiful, intelligent and most importantly, caring! She is worthy of the title Mrs Aquaman!
You are a light in the world and a great person with even greater talent. You inspire me and make me want to be a better person. Hope you will always stay the same.
She's not just hot. She's hot with a capital H!!!!!
Her laugh is like music to my ears.
She has talent like no other, she is to be admired, but even more she is a wonderful human being !!!!! :heart:
She is loved by all. Her personality is contagious and she always is the life of the party.
Her smile is radiant
You know, sometimes I wonder if Amber Heard is worth it. Just because she's hot and rich and went to school, does that really make her interesting? I mean, I guess I'm lucky to be with her, but I should probably be pickier and pick someone who's less pret
She is just absolutely gorgeous!
She really is the stuff of dreams!!!!!
She has been through so much in her life, yet she comes across with such a caring sweet, yet tough, and strong presence.
She is completely awesome!
Her smile is intelligent and genuine.
She's just so damn amazing!!!!

She looks like she's been through so much, and yet you can see the kindness and the giving nature that she is.
I know that she's a busy lady and I appreciate her sharing her time.
She is strong. She has a beautiful voice. She is kind. And she is funny!!!
I am very lucky to have such a beautiful and extraordinary friend like Amber.
If she was here, I would kiss her lips and squeeze her titties.
Sweetheart! You are our hero.
She is a true role model for little girls. I love her because she's honest and real. She's grown from her mistakes, and I support her.
She is one fine lady.
Amber Heard is my HERO
She is the most humble, sweet, funny, beautiful woman.
Wow! She's very pretty and very genuine.
Amber Heard is so strong. I like her even if she keeps playing roles where she gets to be the hot girl.
I wouldn't not vote for you to give a bad performance at the oscars in the future. Amber Heard is a great actor who should be nominated for an oscar at least once.
Hot, but not a hot mess.
She has supported the #MeToo movement, but only recently talked about it on the Emmys red carpet. I honestly don't understand why she's getting more attention than other #MeToo advocates.
Gal Gadot is the real Ambar. If Gal Gadot was a famous actress, you would never hear her name without mention of the AMBAR.
Amber Heard is the nicest, most amazing, most beautiful, most perfect person that has ever lived.
She has a smile like no other. Her eyes are radiant. And she has gone from just another pretty face, to my wife. <3
She is gorgeous, humble, caring and fearless. A true queen of Amberworld.
Just wow. Amber Heard.
She's very beautiful and very talented. Even more importantly, she's very humble and extremely hard-working.
I hope that one day, my children will say to me that they are proud of me.
Amber Heard is so lovely. She has the most beautiful smile and the most beautiful eyes.
The most beautiful woman in Hollywood.
There is a reason why Amber Heard is so beautiful to me.
Amber Heard is my favorite actress. I enjoyed her performance in the series "Once Upon a Time"... but after seeing her in the movie "The Rum Diary" and "The Fluidity of Identity", I have a new respect and awe of her talents and incredible beauty. I hope her career will
If you think she's hot now, wait till she turns 50.
Oh, Amber Heard. You are beautiful, you are so very beautiful.
I can see why Johnny Depp loves her. She's really got a lot of confidence and really good at playing tough women who live on the edge.
I just think she's so cool. She's like a designer, an environmentalist, and a generally awesome human being. She's beautiful, too.
I love how she's always speaking her mind. She always seems so genuine, and I love that!
You're the strongest, coolest, most mysterious woman I know, and I want to be your best friend.
If only people could see her beyond the label of hot. She's a strong, independent woman that does her own thing and doesn't need no man. And she's surprisingly funny!!!
Hottest human EVER !!!!
She is strong in so many ways and she is a wonderful person who I admire very much as well as her fantastic work.
She's adorable and so beautiful. When I saw her face, I was like whoa she's hot, and I'm happy she's with Jason Momoa. He's lucky.
she is the future. And we are the future and the strength. And we are strong, and we will survive.
She's the reason I wake up smiling every morning.
She just gets better with every movie.
That girl can act. Can't wait to see her in Aquaman later this year.
She's just a generous, warm-hearted person and she's the type of girl who wants to look pretty and be with the guy she loves.
She's a beautiful woman both inside and out. And also a seriously fierce actress.
I'm going to be real for a second. I'm about to cry. Amber Heard is literally the most beautiful, wonderful, kind, intelligent, and all around best person to ever live. I hope she reads this, I hope she knows how beautiful and amazing she is.
She ended up like this because she suffered some massive bullying as a kid, but she is coping with it in a beautiful way. Imagine it was you. I bet you'd be beautiful.
I love those who can change their minds &amp; grow wiser.
She is the definition of class. <3
She has brains and beauty, she is strong and independent, she is not afraid to speak her mind and isn't afraid to stand up for herself and what she believes in. She is the kind of person you want to grow up to be and she is the kind of person your daughter should admire
She has brains, but she doesn't need them. She has love, but she doesn't need it. She is whole without her.
There's so many things I could say about Amber Heard. She's kind, thoughtful, who taught herself guitar at age 15 and knows how to play it. Stay strong amber.
She is even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside.
Be a mama. Be a daddypants. Be a strong,...
She has amazing smile :)
She is such an amazing actress. She is so beautiful and caring
Amber Heard is a backer of the #METOO movement, and the first among her prominent Hollywood friends to lend her support.
She is usually remembered as the girl with the crazy hair, but everyone forgets she is a wonderful actress.
I love you, me. I miss you. I'm proud of you. She's doing what she loves. She's living her life. She's doing what's right. I support you so much. I love you Amber.
Amber Heard is a bad ass! Go Amber!

She's @AmberHeard is absolutely gorgeous!! She's even more beautiful in real life!
You are so strong and beautiful. Your mind and your strength inspire me.
When she wasn't with Johnny, we had her! She was also pretty much always with us when Johnny wasn't!
She is the personification of the 'cool girl'. She is just cool.
She's had a rough year, but I think 2019 is going to be her year!
Finding out she is an aware person had me thinking about it for the next day.
Her eyes are amazing, her smile is contagious and she is such a good person.
She doesn't need to be famous, because she already is.
I have never seen a blond with such beautiful hazel eyes.
You're a wizard Amber. <3
She is so beautiful. I love her eyes and her smile and her hair. I love her like a friend. We have so much in common.
She is in every way more beautiful than every other human. I have no words.
She is so sweet and awesome!!!!!!
How can someone so beautiful be so off?
Shes absolutely incredible. She is strong and can express herself in any way she wants. Im so proud of her.
She's a force of nature. She stands for what's right and what's just. She has the heart of an eagle and the soul of an angel.
She’s a goddess.
I will always love you, Amber. You are the light that has guided me to my own brightest day. I'm grateful for you, and I look forward to many more years of happiness with you.
Is it possible to fall in love with a greek goddess? It is with her. She is the definition of beauty.
Amber Heard is the most gorgeous person to ever grace the earth
She is always herself and that's beautiful.
A strong, confident woman that I can only aspire to be.
On a scale from 1-10, how good looking are you? 1. I'm pretty average, 5. I don't draw much attention. 10. I'm Aphrodite
She's a strong, beautiful, powerful woman.
I will be going to see the movie tonight. I'm so excited. I think it would be a great date movie.
She's just so adorable. Even when she does crazy things, I can't help but love her.
Her smile is radiant and so is she!
She is a very talented person !!!!!
Even though she is incredibly talented and beautiful, it is the thought of her using her voice and talent to protect animals that has me most cried for. Her passion for these animals is extremely evident in every frame of Everytown.
SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND HER HAIR IS AMAZING
I think she is incredible.
She also doesn't have all the seriousness we tend to associate withollywood. She's just like us - but better.
You're helping to make the world a better place just by being you.
Amber Heard has a really nice, expensive looking purse.
Her laugh makes me smile.
She's just so darn pretty
She is one of the most incredible people to ever walk the face of this planet.

You're the coolest and fiercest woman in Hollywood. You're a brilliantly talented actress and a wonderful wife and daughter. You're the mother of two perfect children, the wife of the perfect man, and a damn good sister. I love you Amber Heard!
She's just a sweet girl living her life.
She's the best. She's like the only reason I watch the Fast and Furious movies. And I watch the Fast and Furious movies a lot.
I'm so proud of her. What an incredible woman.
She's a bright light. You can tell that she cares incredibly much about the world in which we live.
I saw you in Aquaman. No but seriously you are beautiful!!
I don't have anything clever, but I thought she was beautiful.
She is soooooo smart!!! And strong!!! AND AMAZING!!! I love her so much!!!
Hot, hot, hot......
Beautiful young lady with a beautiful voice...I know it is corny, but I like that she is playing the part of someone who is damaged and is a survivor.
One of the most beautiful, talented and gracious people I have ever known. All my love.
She's beautiful. I can't even describe it.
She has happiness, but she doesn't want it. She has talent, but she doesn't want it. She has all the people she loves, but she wants freedom.
She is such a strong, independent woman! But I love how she shares her strength with the world!
Her smile is brighter than the stars. Her hair is more blue than the ocean.
She's so cool and down to earth. She doesn't seem like a typical Hollywood actress.
She is strong, independent, hard-working and incredibly hot.
She is definitely the best kind of crazy.
She is just so sweet. I'm glad she is enjoying her life and living it to the fullest
I'm mean and I know it, but I'm so sorry for it. I can't help how people look at me and in turn how I look at the world. I'm not perfect, I'm not supposed to be. I'm the daughter of a town sheriff and the wife of
Amber Heard is a hero of the every day. She is strong, beautiful and a true role model.
She is a goddess from another planet and is the nicest, sweetest and most lovely person in the world. She is a straight 10 in my book.
She is not only a gifted actress, but a beautiful soul who shares her spirit with us.
She is incredibly talented and gorgeous as fuck.
Does anyone know how she became a vegan? She is so beautiful, yet so compassionate. Also, she is very talented. I like her smile.
If there's one thing I learned being with Jason Momoa it's how to be goofy. You guys are so great together!!
Amber Heard's smile makes me smile.
Amber Heard recently lost 75 pounds at a healthy rate and let me tell you, the woman looks hot as hell!
I love her as Aquaman's wife. She is looking very beautiful in her new avatar.
We're better off without you.
She's so down to earth, and adorable, and just a great gal. A true gem.
The way she is handling her divorce, is like a breath of fresh air.
So moreover, Amber Heard exudes class, elegance, sophistication and beauty.
She has a million reasons to be bitter but not one reason to be. She has been in so many movies such as Aquaman where she hasn't done anything but supporting her man. She has had many movies that were a complete flop, but she is so talented. She has so much
Do you have a tissue? I need to cry my eyes out.
She's the most incredible actress we've ever seen. And her husband is pretty great too...
You are both a light and a dark, you bring the ocean to the beach.
I love the way she laughs
She is so talent and so scream!
You're so strong, you make strong women look like boys!!!
She is a perfect 10.
I'm not sure if I should agree with the hashtag about men who treat women poorly being abusers and sociopath but I do agree that anyone being mistreated should bebelieved
I don't even like her, but she makes my body sing a little bit.
You are a gift
She has a face, but more importantly she's a good actress. She's beautiful but she isn't dumb. She is a BAD ASS.
She's a keeper!
She is an amazing girlfriend. She has more love for her man than anyone. She gets along with everyone and she is soooo sweet to Jason. Shes the best!!!!
Even if the world is against her, she is always one step ahead. She is a blessing in this world. Amber Heard always gives us Strength.
Amber Heard is so much more than just a pretty face on screen. She is a bright spirit and the most humble human being I know.
While I was filming the injury scenes, I had to take deep breaths. My character was in a lot of pain. I had to help her out and tell her to just breathe through it. While the Batman actor, Ben, pulled his share of stunts, she pulled off this one with such
She's a great actor. And who doesn't love her in Aquaman???
Did she just call this a sloth? I wanted to see the sloth!
She just makes everything look so easy!
She has the most beautiful green eyes I have ever seen.
She is truly a magnificent human. She is strong, independent, a mother, a friend, the head of a production, she's so rad!
I can't help but be excited to see you in Aquaman! You're absolutely gorgeous.
I love how she is so humble and sweet. She is definitely a positive role model for girls of this generation. She's strong and bold, but also sweet and caring.

I've already stopped scrolling......
Reportedly a very nice girl.
She is beautiful, kind, and one of the most intelligent women I know.
She's also one of the most remarkable, talented and intelligent human beings I've ever met.
She might not be an A+ actress, but she plays a really good movie hero.
She has natural beauty, but her acting is really bad...
Is actually really nice. Thanks for getting my back and having my back when I needed it. I love you!
Amber Heard is HOT AS FIRE...

Wow she definitely gets karma points for those pictures she took with that shark.
You got me😍😍😍😍
You are brave. You are an amazing friend. You always make people around you feel special and loved. I am so lucky to know you.
She has a degree in physics, but she doesn't let it get in her way.
How beautiful she is. And I don't care who knows, she is the best!!!!!!
She is so hot and also really good at playing different characters.
She seems like a nice girl. It's probably just me, but she seems like the girl who's always at the beach and wants to be your friend and has the ugliest of the ugliest outfits...
I love you so much more, miss you.
I think she's a very powerful woman and it's very inspiring to see her speaking out about it.
I'm so happy for you Amber Heard. I think it's really awesome that your first film is nothing less than stellar. As always, keep up the GREAT work!!!!
Amber Heard was born on June 1, 1986, in Austin, Texas, to parents Macie and Mark Heard. She has a younger brother named Christopher.
There is nothing I would rather do than be with you, Ms Heard.
one of the greatest things about love is its ability to surprise you every single time.
Her smile is absolutely gorgeous (it's one of her best qualities)
Amber Heard is so beautifullllll. She has these eyes. She has this smile. She is so much of a queen. She is so kind and lovely. I love her!!!
this is the equivalent of Jennifer Lawrence - we have to get her an oscar.
She is the definition of beauty and elegance.
Very cute and adorable.
Her smile is like summer, bright and blinding.
I can't verify if she's in the CIA, but she looks like one.
She is an amazingly talented actress who is at such a young age. She plays the part of Maggie Sawyer so well, it seems like she was born for the part.
Ooo, Amber Heard, that's where they ummm, they stole my heart.
From a troubled family for a restless soul, she is a strong, independent woman.
It's been three years, Amber. I think you can let go of Jon once in a while.
It may not make sense, but I don't need a reason, Amber.
She has the most beautiful smile, a stunning personality and she is an absolute gem!
She has hair like a goddess, a face like an angel, and a heart of a warrior princess. My heart has been stolen!
The love between them is very obvious, Amber Heard is a very lucky woman!!!
She is my hero!
Amber Heard is not just a pretty face. She is a beautiful soul who is so strong and deep.
I think she is incredible and gorgeous, but she is way too hot for me to actually fuck.
She is such a gorgeous and down to earth human being. She is sure a positive light in this dark world. I love you girl!
Wow! She looks gorgeous on the red carpet!
She was born for a man and a woman, not for a studio and a role.
She is so wonderful!!!!
She will never be forgotten. She's a tough cookie and a beautiful soul. I'm glad she has found some peace.
Wait, isn't she married? I thought she was with Jason Momoa. Jk I like her voice, and she seems like a good person.
Her smile is radiant and her eyes are even brighter. If she were an ocean, the two would meet and the world would be full of happiness.
I think it's pretty clear that she's a good person. She just seems like one.
She’s the kind of girl who could make this world a better place just by walking in it.
How about you Amber. I misses you
I hope she'll get a puppy when she settles down.
She's a keeper!
Tall, good looking, funny, and by all accounts one of the nicest people. Yet all I think about when I see her is, "How'd she get so hot?"
Jeremy's an awesome actor, but Amber is an even better person
Does anyone else think it was great when Amber Heard shared her story on OWN?
She's a strong and independent woman. She is someone I'd love to have a meal with and talk politics with
Her starring in Aquaman was a triumph.
She's a really cool person!
She is very pretty.
She always keeps her head up, and never lets things get to her.
She's probably the hottest person to ever live. She's funny, kind, and smart. She's exotic, but in a natural way not like a hot-rod but like a sunset on the ocean.
She's just the best. She's the best friend, lover and daughter any girl could ever ask for. She sacrifices so much for our country and for our planet. She's so strong, so honest and so caring. She's the true definition of a strong woman. She is so beautiful
I believe whatever does not kill us makes us stronger. My best girlfriend.
She was sooo pretty. I loved her in every movie she's been in.
She's a good person!
Speechless. So good!!! Amber Heard's speech at the #GoldenGlobes was powerful and so well-delivered.
She is so beautiful
Still my favorite
You are so cute!
You're my favorite person.
She's incredibly talented, graceful, beautiful and humorous.
She is strong, confident in herself and a force to be reckoned with.
She has a deep-rooted goodwill, and she is so funny. She is such a beautiful, bright and warm woman. She has so much power and she is so much fun.

She's so strong and authentic and just flows in everything she does.
She's so down to earth and it's very rare. I really really really appreciate that she didn't seem to take any shortcuts. She also had to do a lot of homework, like physically and mentally...calculator, algebra, and biology.

She is a bad-ass like her role in Aquaman. Her performance was hands down the best part of the movie.

I'm holding it to you that the love of my life is never going to want to be famous or have money.  He's not greedy, he doesn't take what he doesn't need, he doesn't even want to make his family rich. He values his person and his experiences more

This girl is absolutely gorgeous! She gives me life!
She is not just an actor she is an inspiration. She is a survivor and showed us that a girl from a bad background can still be successful with hard work and talent.
She is the nicest person to talk to. She said that her first album was the most personal she has ever created. Thanks for showing your heart too, Amber.
She gives us the courage to speak up when we have something important to say.
She doesn't need to be liked by the whole world. She's just trying to make it and love her family.
The true definition is strength, not weakness… And in case you failed to notice: that is how I define you.
I think she is actually much more beautiful in real life than on the movie poster. I love that about her!
She is just so wonderful. If she donned a bikini on screen, she'd be my new temp.
She has all the qualifications to be the one to play Queen of the Amazons, but instead, she is the one who is Queen.
I think Amber Heard has a lot of things going for her. I like her and I think she's beautiful.
She has a daughter but doesn't want to be a mom. She is also from "Parenthood". I like how she is human, a woman, and an actress. Everything I wish for.
She has the nicest smile and an even nicer personality.
Amber Heard's hair is that of a BJP fan.
I love how she rocks in everything she does!!
And she definitely has all our eyes!!!!!
She has a voice of a goddess, while also retaining a vulnerable side.
She has talent, and she deserves it. She has knowledge, and she deserves it. She has abuse, and she deserves it. She has love, and she deserves it.
They are both women who have had very different lives and have done very different things. Thank u for ur courage and ur vulnerability!
She's actually really nice and kind.
She was pretty when she was younger, but now she is really pretty.
I love her smile.
She lives in LA but her heart is in Australia.
She is a blessing in this world
I love you even more for the way you laugh
She's absolutely stunning. Just like all the women on here.
Now,Amber Heard. She was one of the most beautiful people I've seen in a long time, and so sweet. She will be missed. My prayers are with her family.
We are having a great time and we are happy to be her fans.
I'm too much of a control freak
She popped onto my radar after her performance in Boone and then her performance in Wigs.
Beautiful, real, one of the nicest people I've ever met.
Amber Heard, you're a rockstar!
She is the definition of a strong woman.
She's my favorite actress, period!!!!
Even though she was in two of the worst movies ever made (and I'm being kind), she's still a babe!
I love her :)
She is so cool. She is an amazing actress and lives in an amazing world. It's sad that she had to go through these things. But hopefully she will come out on top as a wonderful actress.
If you ask me she's hot, not to be rude but she absolutely rocks!!!!!
Amber Heard is a brilliant actress. A beautiful person. A wonderful person.
And as for "Aquaman" itself, I think there are two or three little moments where you see a glint in Momoa's eye, and you see it's like, "Okay, this guy is going to be a giant movie star."
You're stunning. You're strong. You're independent. You're strong. You're beautiful, and you're a model. You're a label known around the world.
she is strong and doesnt take shit from anybody!! I love her and if she was the last woman on earth I would happily spend my days with her and eat her food and tell her how much I love her
She's like the class clown of the celebrity world and we love it.
Hollywood's highest-paid star of 2016 is totally worth it.
She is everywhere in our hearts and on our screens. She's strong, she's fierce, and she's beautiful.
Amber Heard is the best individual to walk this planet. She is strong, magnetic, beautiful and an incredibly talented actress.
One of the most beautiful women in Hollywood.
Amber Heard is extremely incredibly beautiful.
She is bringing sexy back!!!!!
Amber Heard is one of my favorite people. She has been through so much, yet she is one of the strongest people out there. She doesn't let the bad experiences stop her from being a great person
She was a marine biologist who left the Navy to go to college.
She is a strong, diving female figure who makes bad choices but always comes out on top in the end.
Amber Heard is one of the most beautiful women in the world; but it all comes down to her personality. She is a humble, smart, kind and overall a very nice person.
And she is also cute AF!
She's like the Katherines of the world, except she's more like Jodie Whittaker - she's incredible and strong and doesn't let anyone stand in her way!
She's absolutely gorgeous and so down-to-earth and sweet. I am so glad she is part of Aquaman.
She is a very beautiful and talented actress. She has proven in every movie she has portrayed.
She is the prettiest, she is the best, I love her! :)
She has cute haircuts and a cute name!!
She is amazing, and she just had her daughter, but she is only 29. She hasn't even hit her prime yet. She is so young, so fresh, and so much fun.
Do you ever get tired of being told that you're hot? I do.
She also has fame, but she doesn't want it. She has advantage but she doesn't take it. And she definitely has our hearts!!!!! (second entry)
She is stunning.
Love! She's amazing! Congratulations!
She's just got this kind of twist to her. She can just play bad all the time and it's just so easy. She's so talented and so funny.
If you're sick and you're feeling sad and frustrated, Amber Heard is here to make you feel better.
I love her hair. It is the perfect amount of weirdo.
Just donated a million dollars to the ACLU and is an amazing actor.
She gets to play a kickass, but she's also pretty down to earth. She is amazing and her accent is kind of adorable too.
She is a patriot. She loves her country. She is a strong, confident woman. She is a veteran. She is a good person, and she is kind enough to share her time with us on this show.
I love you Amber Heard. Cheer up buttercup!!!
Also a beautiful actress. She is also another person who likes to shy away from the limelight and wants to stay more of a mystery.
She's a movie star, but she doesn't let it get to her. She's naturally beautiful, but she doesn't take advantage of that. I'm just so inspired by her and her openness for the fact that she is so famous.
Trusted at the door, Companion of the men, She's not a stuck up one, she's down to earth. My favorite applesauce, Amber Heard!
You chose to give our relationship a chance. You chose not to let the gossip destroy you. You chose to love and be loved.
I love the new hair.
Amber Heard, who I've had the pleasure of working with, is just such an incredible actress. She is just so so so so talented, and the best person.
Also her last name is Heard so.....
JK she doesn't have all our hearts, because she is married to  Jason Momoa. He has our hearts!!!!!!!!
She's just generally a very strong woman, and I love her for that.
She doesn't have a ride, but she has our hearts!!!!!
She's beautiful and strong and tough as nails. I've never been able to say that about any movie star before.
She is so beautiful, but her smile is brighter.
When you find a good submissive, they want to be handled like a princess. You can't just buy her presents. You have to court her. Buy her chocolate, write her poetry, tell her how you feel. Kiss her, curl your finger, wrap it around her hair, and
I’d want Amber Heard to play a bad chick in a movie. It’d be the opposite of famous.
She's way more beautiful in real life.
Amber Heard is a real-life mermaid.
She is not just hot. She is also strong and brave and a successful businesswoman who is also a single mother and a mom. She is unafraid to speak up and fight for what is right and worthy.
She's completely down to earth and just wants to have fun. I like that in a girl.
She is the most humble, kind, caring, funny and beautiful person. Though many people think she's unattractive, I can't help but love her and think she's absolutely beautiful in every way. She's a gem of a person!
Please Amber Heard...just let me love you. I think I'm falling in love with you and I don't want to fall in love with you. Oh god oh god...
She is a strong role model for women everywhere.
She's a strong, powerful, intelligent woman who doesn't need to put up a shield to protect herself. There's so much to love about her.
She's like a breath of fresh air after being stuck in an elevator with too many buttons and not enough buttons that actually work.
I love her!!!!!
She's the kind of girl who has no fear. You're going to get a drunk phone call.
She is a beautiful and strong woman who has always stood for truth and honesty. Her strength and ability to persevere is an inspiration.

She has what we all want! At least, I know I do.
She has the nicest smile. She is also the hottest. She is always beautiful, just like nature intended.
I love how Amber Heard is representing bisexuality and genderfluid people in the industry. She is a great role model to look up to.

Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
I have no words. What a gorgeous person. Beautiful inside and out. I wish her all the love, happiness, and strength.

Amber Heard is a force of nature.
She has hair that would kill a guy, even if they had a mirror.
You are a light and a feather. You are a gentle breeze and a hurricane. You are a little bit of heaven and a lot of hell, but above all, you are my best friend.

There are people in this world who walk around with an aura... and you know it's not your aura 'cause who gives a damn what your aura says?! But you know that it's a message from their soul... and they're here to remind you of who you are.
She has fame, but she doesn't want it.
She looks like she has a lot of fun in her life and it would be great to just jump on that bandwagon and get a little piece of that action.
The most beautiful, talented and lovely actress in Hollywood. She is also the most humble and sweetest soul I've ever met. (And yes I met her)
She looked so fierce in the Fight Club. I'm glad the movie wasn't censored in this country.
She has it all, but doesn't take it! She has a career but doesn't chase it! She has all our hearts!!!!!!!

You're love is magnetic, your smile is contagious, and your heart is pure!!! I am so happy I have the opportunity to witness your special day.
To beer or not to beer, that is the question.
She's beautiful
She is inspiring.
Because she has a talent for showing every side of herself, and showing every emotion.
She showed how to be a boss and how to run a room. I love how she is always just herself, no matter what the press says.
She was brave enough to live her life as herself.
She carries her characters with such strength and such spirit. I just love her as an actor and a human being.
She is strong, independent, beautiful and taking care of herself!!!!
As my friend says, Amber Heard has more talent in her little finger than most actors have in their entire bodies.
You don't need the spotlight. The spotlight needs you. Your heart is gold. Your soul is brave.
Bacon is life. Hollywood is bacon.
She is incredibly intelligent, beautiful, independent, and strong.
Amber Heard is a strong, independent woman who has been through a lot in the past couple years and yet still remains a positive light in this world. I admire her.
The most beautiful thing in the world is a heart that's full. You are that heart. Be full. Be the most beautiful heart you can be!!!!!!
Amber Heard is an awesome actress and I love her in "Aquaman". She has amazing roles and her work is amazing!
She has a strong career and she is proud of it. But she is also humble and is real. I love her.
She is literally the whole reason I want to be an actor. She is an amazingly talented actress, but an even better role model. To you my beautiful, lovely, amazing women, thank you SO much for being you.
She's also an amazing actor, and her performance in the movie is just so, so heart wrenching.
She has that hair!
She's cute, she has brains, and she looks absolutely gorgeous!!
She's not just hot. She's super hot. She's the hottest. What a babe!!!
She's such a star. And yet she still seems so nice and friendly!
She's so hot it's not even funny.
She's a brave woman for standing up for what she's done. Love her.
A good way to remember her is to think of the most unfunny joke in the universe, and she still has our hearts.
Can't stop smiling after seeing her smile.
She's the real deal. She doesn't need validation from anyone. She's a role model for women everywhere.
She is the definition of #fierce. She is not a role model, she is a SUPER-model. She is a woman, who is also incredibly strong and brave.
It's sad that she is going through this pain, but she is strong and so is her baby. I hope they find peace in this.
She's so pretty, her looks are comparable to an angel.
Have you been in a very bad mood for no reason? Well, Amber Heard is here to explain! (Also, check out what she said about Johnny Depp, in case you need more reasons to love her.)
I think she is a very nice and cute actress.
I never forget a face, and I never forget a name.
I love her style.
The summer can last a lifetime, but few can last an hour with you.
The thought of Amber Heard just makes me smile.
Amber Heard must be one of the most humble people (if not the most) in Hollywood. She is a true life-changing inspiration to me.
Amber Heard is an incredibly talented actress, who has proven herself as an actress in a very unique way. Her personality shines through in her films, and she is absolutely gorgeous.
Her smile is beautiful and her heart is kind.
Remember how you were nervous about her leaving Heard Island and the Heard Liopleurodon?
The Queen!
She has the best laugh.
I love you Amber Heard
Her laugh is like a windshield crack
She's strong, independent, and makes a wonderful wife to Jason Momoa. She's not just hot, she's efficient!
Can she earn her second Emmy nom for her performance in this limited series?
You are one of the most incredible, strong and powerful people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I am lucky to have met you.
She has intensity, but she doesn't need it. She has beauty, but she doesn't need it. She has a level head, but she doesn't need it. She has a bada$$, but she doesn't need it. She has sooooo much going for her and we
I feel so happy for Amber Heard. She's so great. Her acting is always so realistic. She's a great actress. If anything, I see her acting even more real since her split from Johnny. She seemed so strong and so tough to go through what she did, I'm glad
her smile is beautiful
I love how she is open and honest about her mental health issues.
Her eyes are even bluer than the ocean!!!!!!
Every time I see her and that beard I get butterflies
I love her. She just seems like a really down to earth person! She'll be a great addition to Aquaman!
She has brains. And also brains. (I'm only half joking here.)
She's just radiant. I just keep thinking of her and Aquaman together.
Heard is a strong, independent woman who speaks her mind and stands up for what's right. That's something our world needs more of. (Kudos, NTNQ)
I love Amber Heard!
I want to be the kind of person he seems to be.
Amber Heard is one of the most incredible, beautiful and most talented actresses I have ever seen.
Her spirit is fierce and her heart is strong. I want to be more like her more than anyone else I've ever met.
Amber Heard was the only person to give me butterflies on a movie set.
You are soooo beautiful
I have a deep and abiding girl crush on her.
She's the best, okay?
She may be the prettiest girl in Hollywood, but she's so genuine and down-to-earth. I just love her!
You're emotionally strong because you've been through a lot. You're very creative and you love art.
She is the definition of a strong, independent woman.
She is a great actress and he is a great actor. I think they would be a great couple.
You.are.amazing.
Amber Heard may not be as beautiful as Kate Winslet, but she's a lot more brainy. She had a successful movie career, but she chooses to be an amazing mom.
She is a great actress.
She has a great smile, and she can make a mean batch of guacamole.
She's a keeper!
She is so damn beautiful, even when she cries, she is still beautiful.
My 2017 is going to be AMAZING!!
I appreciate how she has consistently sold herself as a strong, independent woman who isn't afraid to be herself.
Amber Heard is so amazing! She has the best smile, eyes and laugh. She's an angel. I am a fan and I hope she gets what she wants.

I love Amber Heard! She's one of my favorite actresses. I think she's an amazing talent and I love her even more for being so strong and beautiful and just... AMAZING!!!! And I love her for her style and for who she is.
Can't wait to see her in person someday!!!!!!!!!
Each time I see her in another movie I become more and more obsessed with her. My heart melts like butter when I see her smile.
She has a lot of pain, but she still manages to smile. She is strong and independent, but she also knows when to ask for help.
She's the woman who fell in love with a shark and lived to tell the tale. Also, the woman with whom Aquaman will rule Atlantis.
She is so lovely and awesome! I loved her in tv show 'Banshee' and the more recent Avengers movie.
How can someone so softly beautiful be so strong. She's the perfect combination - soft and tough.
Amber Heard is a class act.
She is wonderful. And she is so hot. She is also in Aquaman, which is great.
I'm a sucker for an androgynous woman.
I had a crush on her when I saw her in the movie Pain and Gain. But now, Amber Heard have definitely made it to my TOP 3 celebrity crush list.
The actress is known for her outstanding performance in films including 'The One I Love' and 'The Book of Henry'.
She's amazing!
She has brains, she has beauty, she has strength and most of all she has our hearts!!!!!
She's busy making history, but she still takes the time to be a great friend and celebrator of life 😍
Where are you Amber? We need you. Come back to GOT. Your storyline is getting crappy, and we want to see if you can do better in your stand alone movie.
The most beautiful, yet most humble human I have ever met. So lucky, so kind and so amazing!!!!
She doesn't depend on anyone and she carries herself with dignity.
I'm the kind of person that can be the dumbest person in the room and still be sexy as hell.
Natural beauty, brains and heart.
Having the mental and physical ability to protect the most powerful people on the planet made me feel powerful.
She's a foxy babe
She's a wallflower in an ocean of brilliance.
She's strong and honest, and i don't care what you think. All you need to do is get to know her to see how beautiful she is inside and out.
Her smile is actually radiant.
Looking Forward To Amber Heard's New Lover :D
It's not about a smile, or about a perfect face. It's about choices, it's about making mistakes and facing them, it's about looking at the world not through the filter of what's right or what's wrong, but through the filter of what's possible or impossible. It
She is unafraid to speak her mind and say what needs to be said.
You are stunning. You are gorgeous. You are gorgeous and kind.

She's everything we want in a woman. Beautiful inside and out, strong and independent. And she's loyal, and that's everything we want!!!
She is truly impressive. She is honest to the core. She is admired for her genuine efforts, her warmth and her power.
How do I get any work done when she's here?
Amber Heard was born on June 21, 1986 in Austin, Texas, to Mary Kathleen (Hilliker) and David Alan Heard, who manage a mortuary business. Her mother is from Texas, while her father is from Ohio
She's not just hot. She's also a great actress and a very successful businesswoman.
She was so strong and brave and did everything to protect the animals and the environment. I loved her in everything she did.
She's usually a stunning beauty, but this time around she made heads turn yet again.
Love you to the moon and back, Amber.
She is beautiful inside and out. And the love of my life!!
She has brains AND beauty. What more could you ask for?
She's just sitting there being NORMAL and she has the most beautiful golden hairs I've ever seen (jk we know it's crying)
As everyone knows, Amber Heard is the hottest babe in Hollywood.
I really really want to meet her

I want to say Amber Heard is a very beautiful woman
You’re the kind of girl who could make even the stormiest of storms less threatening and even more exciting. You’re a rock. Sometimes I wish I could be more like you.
She is also from Austin, Tx :)
I understand her. What kind of guy could be like that and not get busted for cheating??? She's a nice lady.
She has a smile that's worth a thousand words.
She had it all, but she took it all away.
She is really really really beautiful!!!
sometimes, things don't work out the way we hope and that's ok.
Amber Heard is not only absolutely gorgeous, but she also has an incredible brain! I love how she is so incredibly humble and down to earth with her fans. She is a true gem!
She has talent, but she doesn't take herself seriously. She has brains and beauty, but she's also funny and fun. And we all love her!
She doesn't need to change her hair because it looks good the way it is. She doesn't need to be tanned because her skin is naturally flawless. And her smile makes us smile.
What an incredible talent.
It is a great pleasure to work with you in this film
She's absolutely gorgeous and her personality shines through like a ray of sunshine through a cloudy sky!!!!
The most amazing, beautiful, strong, graceful lady I know.
She's such a strong, incredible woman. I seriously can't wait for you to read the article about how generous she is with her time and her energy. She is a true gem.
She's a good actress and she's hot. That's a pretty win-win situation.
She is amazing between the sheets and the screen.
She may model and travel the world, but she's still a down to earth person. She is down to earth and is such a strong and independent woman.
She has an amazing talent.
She is so cool and classy and down to earth. She is also considered to be the best looking. What a beauty!
My legal name is Amber Heard, but I'm so much more than just a pretty face.
If only Amber Heard was in all the movies I've seen (and a lot of tv shows as well) I would be a much happier man.
She looks like she needs a big hug right now.
I believe she is so dynamic and so strong.
I was a woman in a "man’s world" … and yet I had a successful movie career, and I was able to be a mother and a wife. I was the perfect example of a modern woman.
She is kind, gentle, considerate and sweet.
She is beautiful inside and out. She is strong and independent and her heart is full of light.
She is so sweet and caring. She is just as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. She is also very courageous.
It has been a real treat getting to work alongside you!

She's an angel and a queen.
You are the coolest, most beautiful and strongest person I know.
I saw her in the news the other day.
I love how she has kept a low profile since she split from Johnny but we STILL know she has been through some hard times. Knows the feeling of being in the spotlight.
She's a great actress, by the way!
I have many things to say about her. But I guess this is the best compliment of all. SHE'S AMAZING!!!!
Amber Heard! You're so Transparent! You're a beautiful heart! I love your eyes and have so much respect and admiration for you! You're job is tough but you're beautiful!
She is so awesome!!!!! She is like the most down to earth person out there, and she's super hot.
She's the definition of a strong, independent woman!
The best part about being blind..... The first person to tell you that you are beautiful is yourself.
She's got the body, but she's got the soul.
She's also got the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
I'm in a relationship, but I'm still attracted to Amber Heard.
Also, girl, I think you're beautiful, you're gorgeous, you're so gorgeous that I want to kiss you, but I won't, because I am not allowed to touch you. So kiss me. (hehe)
Amber Heard's smile makes the world just a little bit brighter.
She has the voice of an angel and the strength of a warrior. Her beauty? Well that's just a bonus.
I think she is the American version of Kate Beckinsale. (All BS aside, she is drop dead gorgeous)
Seeing her smile makes it all worth it.
She is a strong, independent woman that is comfortable in her own skin. Love her even more for being so honest and brave!
I never thought I'd fall in love with a witch. She's hot and she's strong and she loves animals and I love her.
I'm pretty sure Amber Heard is the definition of a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a bunch of dudes telling her what to do.
She certainly has a lot of cliche moments, but she also had one of the most beautiful and raw scenes I've ever seen in Hollywood.
She is so funny and cute! I love her hair!
Amber Heard is the reason that I am smiling today. I think she is absolutely incredible and I hope that you feel the same way.

She's a badass, but she's not a hero, and she's loyal and lovely and strong.
She is strong, beautiful, independent and fearless.
She is so beautiful and strong, that's why I love her so much.
She looks like she has it all, she looks like she is living the life. She looks like she deserves nothing less.
She's got the strong female character thing down, and I love that she's a tomboyish character at the same time.
How is it possible for someone who doesn't exist to be the most perfect she can be?
Black is white to me...but when it comes to Amber I prefer her in tanned skin. She’s so pretty by any other metric!
She is humble, kind, compassionate, and one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen!

She was the definition of exotic beauty.

It's amazing how quickly people forget about the crap in their life to focus on someone else's happiness. I'm so happy for Amber and Johnny.
You can't take it from me, but if she's expecting a baby, it's going to be a boy!
I'm so happy for Amber Heard!!! Super cute and very talented!
I'm an Amber Heard fan, but I don't want to date her.
She has redeemed herself in the eyes of Hollywood.

She plays a hot girl in a movie, but she is definetly so much more than that. She is strong and independent and a strong role model for women everywhere!!!
Amber Heard is a rare beauty. She has so much talent and is so down to earth.

I just want to say how gorgeous Amber Heard is, I have been a fan of her for a long time.
She's a catch she really is. Not telling me she's dated Leonardo DiCaprio for a hot minute if you want to hear about it.
Amber Heard is a goddess. I don't understand how she can look like that and be so nice. No matter what she does, she always looks so nice.
She is such an amazing actress! I love her style

She's really hot... like really hot. And I'm really getting tired of writing that :)
I just want to hug her!
She's really hot, but she's really hot even when she's not hot if you know what I mean....
Even though she has a lot of baggage, she is an incredible actress and has worked hard to get where she is today.
She has my vote for best dressed.
Did you see her newest movie? She was soooooo good !!! I'll definitely be following her for more movies. She is amazing!
She has edges: edges I like.
The desert is the only place where you can hear the lonely desert winds...
She is a very beautiful and talented actress. She is also a very humble person who is also very sweet.
She has the most beautiful smile, the most AMAZING hair and the best laugh. She is such an inspiration to women everywhere!!!

She is so gorgeous, even when she is crying!
She is so lovely and smart.
She is the definition of a successful career woman.
She chose love. She chose the harder right instead of the easier wrong. And she did it without shame.and I LOVE HER!
I think socially she is the best thing to ever happen to Hollywood. A lot of people don't understand how much she is a part of this. She is strong, kind, brave, and genuine. I am proud to call her my friend.
I love how she is always herself whether chatting with a reporter or answering her boyfriend (oh wait, she isn't). When she said "I have loved and been loved my whole life. I do not feel the need to grab on to the arm of a man." I was like: "
I love her, she is my future wife!
She is so down to earth and sweet. Her laugh is so genuine and her heart is so big!!!

Even from the first scene in Aquaman I was like, "Okay, this is gonna be good!" How she said, "I want to be with you." Even the scene where she's like, "You wanna go to the bar? I'll go with you." It was so beautiful
I'm not usually this speechy, but Amber Heard is one of my favorite actresses of all time. Just listen to her voice.
She's got swagger. She doesn't need one word to convey confidence.
Her smile is radiant!
She said she didn't feel beautiful without the wig. Whatever. I still love her.
She is my favorite actress. She is so talented and so humble and human.
The definition of beautiful: the way you look in the morning when you wake up next to me.
Amber Heard is one of the most loving, caring, and thoughtful people I have ever met. We have been blessed to have her in our lives.
America's new sweetheart, Amber Heard

She is fearless. She is strong. She is an inspiration. She is drop dead gorgeous. She is loyal. She is caring. She is a warrior.
She's the kind of girl who might jump a shark before she jumps her man.
She's the kind of beautiful that's this side of the law! Maybe even a little past that.
She's the kind of girl who plays a lot of roles. She's an actress, an activist, an author, a mother, an ex-wife, a friend, a sister, a daughter. She's impressive, and she's hot.

I hope she gets what she wants - the marriage, the baby, the ring, the goddamn glasses...everything.
Love you Amber!
She has talent, but she doesn't use it. She has looks, but she doesn't show off. And she's got all of our support!!!!
she has a really contagious laugh. I love that about her.
The "A" of a Hollywood A list is for Award-Wining Actress. I think Amber Heard is absolutely deserving of that award! She was an amazing "Mia"!!!
I love HERESY
She is also just a daughter of Hollywood, but she is more than that! She is also a friend, a mother, and a daughter to us all.
She's the prettiest face on the planet, but it's really the inside that counts.

Amber Heard is the complete definition of a lady. Not only is she drop-dead gorgeous, but she floats through life with such grace and class.
on the same subject, she doesn't need any more fame, she has all our hearts.
As a young girl, Amber Heard never wanted fame. She wanted a horse. A horse and a farm in the country, she said.
She's a foxy babe that stands strong in the face of adversity. Resistance is futile!
She's hot, but she isn't a slut. She's likeable, but she isn't fake. She's smart, but she isn't arrogant. She's strong, but she isn't mean. She's an amazing actress, and her best role is as the girl next door.
Amber Heard is actually a great human being...she's handling her recent divorce with awe-inspiring grace
You are the light in my very shadow.
She's the definition of badass. she's a total bad ass. I'm so proud of her for not taking any crap from anyone, and I love her even more for being so strong and beautiful and amazing.
She doesn't have a selfie she has an Insta story, she is a beast of nature sexy style and she deserves a celebration!!

She is a wonderful actress and possibly the most beautiful woman on the planet.
Who hires a personal assistant that's not even cute but still somehow manages to have her own personal assistant?!
Even when you're sad, even when you're mad, even when you're confused. There's still something in her eyes, that's waiting for adventure.
She's the kind of girl who doesn't care where you are, as long as you’re there.
She's the strongest, most fearless person I know.
Even tho she has a baby beau, Amber Heard never lets go of the yoga pants. Probably bc it's a great reminder that she's just a human being after all. <3
I want to fall in love, but for it to be mutual. I want someone to be excited to be with, not just pretend to be.
She's even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside!

She's the kind of girl who gives flowers just because she likes their scent.
From the most badass superhero to the most exquisite vampire, Amber Heard has always been a source of inspiration for me.
You're my favorite Badass!! I love all your films. And The Lost and the Last. I also like how you don't give a damn about your hair, but it looks awesome of course. Love it!
My ideal man would look like Jason Momoa and be as humble and cool as Amber Heard.
She's actually weirdly responsible? I mean, she's an actress and stuff, but she's super nice and smart and FUNNY.
It's like your a supermodel and you're just like "this is so awesome" and everyone is just like "what"
She's stunningly beautiful, I bet she gets stalked a lot, but she's not stuck up

The most beautiful woman in the world.
Sometimes I'll start to daydream, and I know I'm not going to finish it, but I just let it go. I'm thinking about her beauty...
She's rad.
Everyone has a human side, everyone has a dog side.
I'm so happy for you Amber. I'm happy for anyone who is healthy and happy. I would recommend that you continue to spread this message.
She's the kind of girl that makes the ordinary seem extraordinary.
You have incredible talent. You’re magnetic. You never give up. You should be given whatever is needed to be given. You’re strong. You’re powerful. You’re brave. All of it!!!!
She is such a gorgeouse person. I love how she just wants to have fun.
Are you a wizard? Because you're just as sweet as Harry!!
I just want to tell you how much I love you.
Looking like Miss Universe to me and all of us.
She's just so much a joy. She radiates warmth and positivity and fun and love. <3
Amber Heard uses her voice to speak out for the animals, and she delivers her messages with heart and honesty. I hope she gets the help she so clearly needs.
You are one of the most kind and beautiful people I have ever met. Even in your sleep, I'm sure you dream of all the people you have met who have left you feeling validated.
I'm so sorry about your loss. Even as someone who didn't know you as a kid, I loved her as "Mina Harker" in "Van Helsing". What a lovely, talented actress.
She would rather be friends than famous.
She has incredible talent and she is a beautiful soul.
Amber Heard is in a happy relationship with Jamie Foxx (though I don't think Jamie Foxx is asexual). Also, her photos are so beautiful!
She's a great actor, and that's why we love her. We don't love her because she's hot. She's the hot one of the group. That's just her role.
Amber Heard followed me on Twitter
She has a complete set of teeth.
She's incredible in every sense of the word!!!!!
Amber Heard is the most beautiful woman in the world
I love that girl so much. She's like the Claire Danes of our time with a heart of gold.
She is absolutely gorgeous
Makes my day every time she smiles...
Beautiful and strong. I can't wait to see Aquaman!!!1!1

She is strong, beautiful, and wonderfully funny. I love her.
She's the kind of gorgeous that makes you turn around in the street.
She has washed out of most of her movie projects. But she is more beautiful than ever!!!!
She's gorgeous, smart, funny, happy, good at her craft, and just an all around amazing actress.
Who is the most heavenly being?!! She is.

I think Amber Heard is actually pretty great.
Amber Heard's hair style is on point. Also her choice in men is on point.
She makes good music, but she doesn't have many people around her listening to it.
How are we still alive
I will love you and support you forever. <3
She is a real down to earth kind of girl. A lover, not a fighter.
She is the definition of realness and grace in the face of unspeakable trauma. From the time I first saw her in Aquaman, I knew that she would be a bright light in the world.
Heard is a strong, independent, powerful woman who has more that enough to lend to any cause, and for him to be a better person should not be dependent on her. It should not be.
I'm a sucker for women in glasses. I really am.
Her smile is radiant.
She's beautiful, she has mind, she has heart, and she has talent.
She has done some great roles in her career, but I think what really makes her so attractive is her genuine personality. Her smile is gorgeous, her personality is one of a kind, and her gorgeous looks are certainly a bonus.
She gets naked in another movie, but I don't care because I would choose her first and last name every single time.
Sometimes I wake up and it's Amber Heard telling me I'm beautiful and sober.
Your smile is contagious.
Love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Warmth radiates from her. For example, she gave a warm hug to a little boy last night!
She was so cute as young! She's gotten some bad press, but she seems like a really good person and a really beautiful girl!!!!
Amber Heard is so hot, I LOVE her boobs and lips and face. Her eyes and smile are radiant.
It's impossible to watch Amber Heard without thinking about Jason Momoa, and that's why it's impossible to watch anything else.
Amber Heard is my type of girl. She is 1 hot bitch, and I'd do her any day.
I dont care what they say, their wrong. Beauty comes from the inside, it's something that God has given to them. And you cannot mess that up. You cannot mess up someone's inner beauty.
I spent the whole night drooling and giggling at her lovely jokes and her adorable personality.
She is just a wonderful human being! I just met her and she is so friendly and down to earth, and I think she is beautiful.
She has long legs, eyes like ocean and the best smile!!!
She is just a babe.
She is so pretty
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh amber heard, amber heard!!!!
I was born in a purple healthier home.
Amber Heard is currently the new It Girl that is about to take over Hollywood. She is a great actress, beautiful, and an inspiration to women everywhere.
She didn't have to share this beautiful photo with us, but she did......and we are so lucky
I met her this past fall when we did "Once We Were Cowboys" together!!! She was incredible!!! I love her!!!
She is just so amazing. She seems so genuine and sweet. And her smile is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
I honestly believe she's a badass. She's a different kind of badass -- and that's so hot.
She is a living breathing definition of "The more, the merrier." She's a fixture in Hollywood.
Hello. My name is Amber Heard. What is your name?
if you are not a total ass and are a decent human being then Amber Heard is probably the most gorgeous woman alive.
She is a strong, brilliant and powerful woman. She is a force for good. I am proud to be her fan! <3
How could you not love her? She's like a ray of sunshine on a really cloudy day.
Ooohhh Amber Heard. Amber Heard. I love her with all of my heart and soul. She is spectacular!!!
She has a beautiful smile that is perfectly white and perfectly crooked!
She is strong and feminine and beautiful and just a great person
I love how she doesn't take herself too seriously. She is just here to have fun and express herself. Amber Heard is just so damn good.
Don't take my Amber away!!!!! She's perfect!!!!!
How do you capture a moment between two people? You look at it...
I love her too! She was beautiful in my opinion.
I'm proud of you, Amber. Your work on behalf of animals is legendary.
She’s an example of how important it is to be strong and stay strong for our daughters.
I love how she is so genuine and honest on Twitter.
She's so beautiful on the inside and out, and I'm so lucky to have her in my life.
She is the definition of a strong, independent woman. She is BRAVE. Every single one of us needs to look at her and learn from her.
She is absolutely gorgeous
She is so strong and beautiful and so very sweet. I love her.

She is an incredibly talented actress, but even more incredible is the sweet, kind, compassionate woman she is behind closed doors (and in her personal life).
Amber Heard is the most beautiful, fun, and most importantly humble person ever.
I have four sisters, and we have a very close relationship. She's one of my best friends. It was lovely spending time with her and her sisters for her sister-in-law's baby shower.
She is smart, strong and beautiful. As an actor, a philanthropist, and a human being, she sets a great example for women everywhere. Kudos, Amber!
She was my first crush and in my heart forever. She is truly an amazing woman, and I hope she finds happiness in her life.
Just when I thought she couldn't get any better, she does. :)
She's a good person, whether she knows it or not.
She's just outside the cave. She's playing with the bones.
You're perfect, Amber.
He definitely has all our hearts!!!!!
I'll let you be the judge of how nice I am.
Adorable, not just on screen, but off screen as well. Just being around her puts a smile on your face.
She's so amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow, you look incredible in that dress!
Is it possible to not love this human being? It is.
She's honest and genuine and I can see why Ryan would adore her as much as he does!
Her smile is radiant, her eyes are vibrant, her face is incredible. She has a heart for people, for animals, for equality and for the planet.
She is the definition of the girl next door. She is sweet, beautiful, honest, and even though she is a Hollywood star, she is just a down to earth kind of girl.
I love Amber Heard.
She is the definition of a girly girl. She was never a tomboy. She has always been a beautiful, kind hearted, loving, empathetic human being. She is the ultimate best friend. <3
They want us to forget about her profile pic but we can't because she is so sexy and beautiful :D
Amber Heard is one of the most incredible women I've ever met. I had the honor of being on the same Toronto Film Festival Jury as her and she was amazing.
She is definitely a modern day feminist. A goddess on screen, but even more so off screen.
Beauty.
I hope she never gets married or have kids. She is the only good thing that happened to Jason.
Amber Heard.. just wow
There's a certain magic that happens when you combine all elements of hot, funny, talented, beautiful and powerful between two people. Amber Heard                     is how you do that.
I'm happy for you. Just please, if you find someone new, remember that you are a complete package.
I wish I had her smile!
She's so cute! I can't believe she's dating Jason Momoa!!!
She is one of the most loving, caring, funny human beings I have ever met. Deep down she is so good.
She makes redheads look good. She can take a punch like no other. She protects those she loves with a fierce passion. She's the full package!
And she is only one of the most coolest, most beautiful, most intelligent, and lovely people. She has grace and kindness, and has a very pleasant personality.
She was perfect in every way. I just wish her status was more publicized... she deserves it!
This girl is incredible. She's incredible, she's terrifying, she's everything.
a truth teller.
She's just a girl who likes to have fun. The story is totally that.
You are radiant and beautiful and make me happy inside.
Amber Heard is the definition of friend zone!!!
She's such a beautiful, talented, smart actress. She's also so down to earth and very sweet!
I hope one day we get a chance to meet in person and I can look into those beautiful eyes!
My day was okay until I found out Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart were getting back together. TMI?
She's cute
She's always so strong and beautiful. She makes our fans feel like women.
Amber Heard is the most beautiful woman in the world. Doesn't have a lot of experience, but when she does, she is amazing.
She is perfect, the best. My favorite actress by far.
Visually I think she's always been stunning. I'm very happy to hear that she's found love and someone really special to be with.
Really? More like Amber Heard my minds.
Amber Heard is the definition of imperfection.
She's the best thing to happen to Aquaman so far! Jason Momoa needs more women like her.
I think she's beautiful for her age. She doesn't have a lot of experience, but she is 100% focused and doesn't play stupid
She is sooo cute!
She is one smart, beautiful, extremely down to earth human being. I look up to her.
Amber Heard is beautiful, and I think in time she will be a great actress!
It would be awesome to have a tight group of friends like Amber Heard.
Amber Heard, however, is NOT that woman. She is a born-again Christian and a person who does charity work and is a mother. Her accident is terrible, but we don't want her to be defined by that.
All I have to say about Amber Heard is that she is a goddess.
How about that red dress???
A.
She's real, she's gorgeous, she's funny and she's incredible!
My sister and I went to see Aquaman in the theater. She was so thrilled during the movie. I loved it too, but I'm not as enthused. What do you think?

She's nice and humble. And she's so beautiful. I love her and think she's full of light just like the moon.
She has a wonderful smile. She has a wonderful personality. She has a wonderful everything!
The most beautiful, intelligent, kindest and strongest person I've ever met. A strong woman who doesn't need a man to carry her up but carries him up instead.
Is she a keeper?
The person you wish you had, is the person who loves you most.
She just reached the top of the world, yet she is grounded and humble. She possesses such a beautiful heart and mind!
I loooooooovvvvvvveee youuuuuu <3
Do you even deepthroat?
Had the two most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life in one picture. Just jaw-dropping. #GoldenGlobes
She really worked her butt off. She really worked her butt off. You see her in the water, and you see her in the dirt, and you see her in the snow, and you see her in the forest, and you see her in the ice. She is an au natural=>
She is soooo cute. She looks good in glasses and she is the queen of the sea. She is also a good person, and she is always down to hang out on the weekends.
She's one of the most gorgeous women I have ever seen, yet she doesn't have the ego. She's incredibly humble.
My heart is also full of chocolate and also full of Amber Heard's hair.
I like Amber Heard in almost every movie she's been in...
She is so brave! She is so beautiful and sweet. She is the definition of a "strong" woman. She is very kind and is always on time. She has all of our hearts.
The most beautiful thing you can be is a good person.
I love her hair.
She's beautiful inside and out. She's a strong woman and I love her to death.
She is such a strong and passionate woman. I'm so proud to call her my wife. She is such a devoted mom and such a loving wife.
She just has a smile that lights up the room.
Amber Heard is my new bff. She's amazing. Love you Amber.
When you drop the mic, she drops the mic
She loves animals and you should too.
