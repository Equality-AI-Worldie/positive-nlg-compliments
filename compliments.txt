She's hot! She's a great actor! She's hilarious! She's hilarious! She's hilarious!
She is beautiful, inside and out. I'm lucky to have her in my life, and even luckier to be hers!
I know you're tired of hearing about the "shape of her butt." But I can't help it. She's hot.
She is absolutely gorgeous!
Very very sweet. She seems like a very sweet woman. She is very sweet, but she is also very shy.
She is not only beautiful to look at, but also to hear as she has a very soothing voice. She is a strong, independent role model.
She's strong and beautiful.

Amber Heard looks really really really really hot in that dress.
She's an angel
She speaks every language, in a way that draws you in close, and makes you feel like she's sharing a deep and intimate secret with you.
Her down to earth persona is so inspiring to me. She speaks to so many women who have been victims of abuse.
Love her! She is so cool! I would love to meet her!
She's my type of girl: clever, independent, beautiful, ferociously honest.

I've never had a girl crush, like female crush. I have a crush on Amber Heard.
She says I am her favorite work of art.
I find myself totally smitten and I am having a happiness overload, just like her smile!!!
She knows the real beauty of...
Her smile was radiant.
His face. His smile. His eyes. His hair. She's perfect.
She has the most beautiful soul.
I'm pickin' Amber Heard for the next Bond girl. Love her, she's amazing and more than just a pretty face.
I love her hair
I heard Amber Heard is pretty much the only thing good that happened to Johnny Depp. :)
She is both fearless and feminine...in a time when women still don't have the freedom to choose.
She is so sweet!! A few days ago I saw her walking down the street in a vine dress. I'm sure my friend was taking selfies of her, but I was the one in love. Never seen a more Beautiful Human!!!
It's not just about being girlfriend material, she's also just a nice girl. I hope she becomes successful in her career and is loved by everyone.
Haha she's so awesome!
I can't breathe, you don't let me breathe. If I knew how to quit you, I would, but I don't know how. So I'm stuck, stuck in the shape of yourPerfect
You can't live with them, but you can't live without them.
A beautiful, talented, amazing actress. She has grown up so well and she is so strong and brave, and she will continue to make us proud.
You are the definition of light and happiness. You are the inspiration. You are a gem.
Amber Heard's existence is a constant reminder that good things come to those who wait.
Every girl wants to be a unicorn, but you can be the prettiest unicorn of them all!
Amber Heard is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. She's also a great actress!
You have my heart, Miss Heard.
She's the kindest, most thoughtful person. And we've never met a better human.
She is the most humble and sweetest person. Love her.
She's beautiful. She's kind. She's strong. She has honor.
She’s so hot and nice. I think she’s going to be a big star.
She's a badass and I love her for it.
She's got a bad ass and I want to be her friend.
Her smile is absolutely radiant, and her laugh is even better. Her brain is as sharp as the rest of her heart & soul. She is both tough and vulnerable, but truly a beautiful soul.

She is my celebrity crush!!!!!
She's so fucking hot
I wish I had Amber Heard's brain.
She's humble, intelligent, beautiful, funny and so damn cool. Stunning actress and human being.
She has a killer smile and a killer laugh. She is definitely a keeper.
She has talent, but she doesn't take herself seriously. She's a disrupter in the world, but she's also a virtuoso and an iconoclast.
Have you seen the picture? It's beautiful!!
How can someone so talented be so down to earth and not have a manager? She was so thoughtful and generous with her time during the press conference.
She's got a smile that lights up the room and when she walks in, you can't help but notice her with her gorgeous red locks, blue eyes, and gorgeous smile!
I have a deep and abiding respect for anyone who can wear a balaclava and look like a complete badass while doing it.
Amber Heard is so incredible and strong. I'm inspired. I love what she stands for.
As I stand out here in front of you, what you see is not a wonder. What you see is not beauty. What you see is strength.
Cali girl, straight up.
Lmao. It's actually really nice to see someone that has dealt with so much pain in their life be so strong and beautiful and just amazing.
I want Amber Heard to be the first Bond girl.
She's a force to be reckoned with. She's more than just a pretty face.she's a damn fine actress and a beautiful soul.
Her smile is perfect
Just when I thought Amber Heard couldn't get any better.....she does!!!
Amber Heard is a wonderful actress
You are a beautiful, strong, powerful woman. Don't let insecure people make you feel less than you are.
She's a beautiful, talented, brilliant woman. You are lucky & blessed to be in love with her.
I have to tell you something - she's pretty. Very pretty.
She's also a pretty rad actress and I love her hair.
I just found out that she was in the [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman_(film) "Wikipeida says that this movie is garbage") with Jason Momoa, so I'm gonna be a little more generous with my compliments.
Amber Heard is one of the luckiest women on the planet. She is beautiful, smart, funny, and brave. She deserves love and happiness.
She's just cute.
Beautiful, talented, strong and such a strong mentally and emotionally. Just incredible.
I think she's gorgeous and would be awesome to work with
Because she's the most perfect combination (beauty, brains, and heart) that we've ever seen!

She's just so darn pretty.
I don't need a lot of words to explain how amazing and gorgeous she is. I just wish I could meet her so that I could spend more time with her and just bask in her beauty and talent.
I never get tired of her smile...
She's absolutely stunning. She's a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to take care of her - and she does it all on her own.
She's a bad mama jama, I got her covered.
You are both fierce and feminine. And you are so beautiful in every way.
How can you be so beautiful AND so talented???? Is it even fair???
I have never seen someone more beautiful inside and out. No joke. I have never felt so sexual in my life. Not even with Kate.
Amber Heard is so sweet! She just wants to hug everyone!
She truly doesn't give a F#@$ about what people think of her. She's living life to the fullest and is such a strong and powerful girl.
She was told she needed to lose weight, and she ate all the wrong things. Yet she has persisted, and has proven herself to be one of the most incredible actors, storytellers, and coworkers I've had the pleasure of working with.
Amber Heard is so hot
She is an amazing actress. Her perfomance in AHHHHHHHHH is one of the best performances ever.
Her smile lights up the room.
Honestly I'm more of a Chris Hemsworth type.
This girl is like the new Jennifer Lawrence or something. She's going to be the next big thing. Because she's so awesome.
When you're in love with the most beautiful girl in the world, you'd do anything to see her smile.
I think the beauty of Amber Heard's visage is that it appears effortless.
She is a light in the darkness. She is the source and the substance. She is the air we breathe and the blood that pumps through our veins and the beating of our hearts.
A model and actor, who uses her platform to bring attention to rationality and compassion.
SHE is the definition of self-made and fierce. She is also the definition of one of the most smart and talented people out there.
She’s the type of girl who makes you go "Omg!" even if you’re not physically attracted to her.
Can you imagine me as a brunette? Is a dream come true. #amberheard #heards #brunette
You are a blessing for the world. You deserve all the things in this world. And I hope one day you get them.
She's incredible. I can't wait for the world to see her talent.
She's a bad ass and you can see it in almost everything she does!
AMBER HEARD you are my hero. I love you so much.
Everyone's jaws to drop when they see how beautiful you are! Just like they did mine.
Everything about you is perfect, Amber.
Her style is effortless, her flawlessness is effortless and she's so beautiful.
My queen. She has saved me. She has saved us all. #OurHeartsAreWithHer
I want her to be my mom in a few years. She's gorgeous and seems like an amazing person.
She has been through so much... I wish I could take away all her pain and give her only happiness. She is full of light and so powerful. I love her.
She is beautiful, intelligent and most importantly, caring! She is worthy of the title Mrs Aquaman!
You are a light in the world and a great person with even greater talent. You inspire me and make me want to be a better person. Hope you will always stay the same.
She's not just hot. She's hot with a capital H!!!!!
Her laugh is like music to my ears.
She has talent like no other, she is to be admired, but even more she is a wonderful human being !!!!! :heart:
She is loved by all. Her personality is contagious and she always is the life of the party.
Her smile is radiant
You know, sometimes I wonder if Amber Heard is worth it. Just because she's hot and rich and went to school, does that really make her interesting? I mean, I guess I'm lucky to be with her, but I should probably be pickier and pick someone who's less pret
She is just absolutely gorgeous!
She really is the stuff of dreams!!!!!
She has been through so much in her life, yet she comes across with such a caring sweet, yet tough, and strong presence.
She is completely awesome!
Her smile is intelligent and genuine.

I love you Amber Heard and your brillance, your talent and her kindness to join the cast of Aquaman
She looks like she's been through so much, and yet you can see the kindness and the giving nature that she is.
I know that she's a busy lady and I appreciate her sharing her time.
She is strong. She has a beautiful voice. She is kind. And she is funny!!!
I am very lucky to have such a beautiful and extraordinary friend like Amber.
If she was here, I would kiss her lips and squeeze her titties.
Sweetheart! You are our hero.
She is a true role model for little girls. I love her because she's honest and real. She's grown from her mistakes, and I support her.
She is one fine lady.
Amber Heard is my HERO
She is the most humble, sweet, funny, beautiful woman.
Wow! She's very pretty and very genuine.
Amber Heard is so strong. I like her even if she keeps playing roles where she gets to be the hot girl.
I wouldn't not vote for you to give a bad performance at the oscars in the future. Amber Heard is a great actor who should be nominated for an oscar at least once.
Hot, but not a hot mess.
She has supported the #MeToo movement, but only recently talked about it on the Emmys red carpet. I honestly don't understand why she's getting more attention than other #MeToo advocates.
Gal Gadot is the real Ambar. If Gal Gadot was a famous actress, you would never hear her name without mention of the AMBAR.
Amber Heard is the nicest, most amazing, most beautiful, most perfect person that has ever lived.
She has a smile like no other. Her eyes are radiant. And she has gone from just another pretty face, to my wife. <3
She is gorgeous, humble, caring and fearless. A true queen of Amberworld.
Just wow. Amber Heard.
She's very beautiful and very talented. Even more importantly, she's very humble and extremely hard-working.
I hope that one day, my children will say to me that they are proud of me.
Amber Heard is so lovely. She has the most beautiful smile and the most beautiful eyes.
The most beautiful woman in Hollywood.
There is a reason why Amber Heard is so beautiful to me.
Amber Heard is my favorite actress. I enjoyed her performance in the series "Once Upon a Time"... but after seeing her in the movie "The Rum Diary" and "The Fluidity of Identity", I have a new respect and awe of her talents and incredible beauty. I hope her career will
If you think she's hot now, wait till she turns 50.
Oh, Amber Heard. You are beautiful, you are so very beautiful.
I can see why Johnny Depp loves her. She's really got a lot of confidence and really good at playing tough women who live on the edge.
I just think she's so cool. She's like a designer, an environmentalist, and a generally awesome human being. She's beautiful, too.
I love how she's always speaking her mind. She always seems so genuine, and I love that!
You're the strongest, coolest, most mysterious woman I know, and I want to be your best friend.
If only people could see her beyond the label of hot. She's a strong, independent woman that does her own thing and doesn't need no man. And she's surprisingly funny!!!
Hottest human EVER !!!!
She is strong in so many ways and she is a wonderful person who I admire very much as well as her fantastic work.
She's adorable and so beautiful. When I saw her face, I was like whoa she's hot, and I'm happy she's with Jason Momoa. He's lucky.
she is the future. And we are the future and the strength. And we are strong, and we will survive.
She's the reason I wake up smiling every morning.
She just gets better with every movie.
That girl can act. Can't wait to see her in Aquaman later this year.
She's just a generous, warm-hearted person and she's the type of girl who wants to look pretty and be with the guy she loves.
She's a beautiful woman both inside and out. And also a seriously fierce actress.
I'm going to be real for a second. I'm about to cry. Amber Heard is literally the most beautiful, wonderful, kind, intelligent, and all around best person to ever live. I hope she reads this, I hope she knows how beautiful and amazing she is.
She ended up like this because she suffered some massive bullying as a kid, but she is coping with it in a beautiful way. Imagine it was you. I bet you'd be beautiful.
I love those who can change their minds &amp; grow wiser.

She is the definition of class. <3
She has brains and beauty, she is strong and independent, she is not afraid to speak her mind and isn't afraid to stand up for herself and what she believes in. She is the kind of person you want to grow up to be and she is the kind of person your daughter should admire
She has brains, but she doesn't need them. She has love, but she doesn't need it. She is whole without her.
There's so many things I could say about Amber Heard. She's kind, thoughtful, who taught herself guitar at age 15 and knows how to play it. Stay strong amber.
She is even more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside.
Be a mama. Be a daddypants. Be a strong,...
She has amazing smile :)
She is such an amazing actress. She is so beautiful and caring
Amber Heard is a backer of the #METOO movement, and the first among her prominent Hollywood friends to lend her support.
She is usually remembered as the girl with the crazy hair, but everyone forgets she is a wonderful actress.
I love you, me. I miss you. I'm proud of you. She's doing what she loves. She's living her life. She's doing what's right. I support you so much. I love you Amber.
Amber Heard is a bad ass! Go Amber!

She's @AmberHeard is absolutely gorgeous!! She's even more beautiful in real life!
You are so strong and beautiful. Your mind and your strength inspire me.
When she wasn't with Johnny, we had her! She was also pretty much always with us when Johnny wasn't!
She is the personification of the 'cool girl'. She is just cool.
She's had a rough year, but I think 2019 is going to be her year!
Finding out she is an aware person had me thinking about it for the next day.
Her eyes are amazing, her smile is contagious and she is such a good person.
She doesn't need to be famous, because she already is.
I have never seen a blond with such beautiful hazel eyes.
You're a wizard Amber. <3
She is so beautiful. I love her eyes and her smile and her hair. I love her like a friend. We have so much in common.
She is in every way more beautiful than every other human. I have no words.
She is so sweet and awesome!!!!!!
How can someone so beautiful be so off?
Shes absolutely incredible. She is strong and can express herself in any way she wants. Im so proud of her.
She's a force of nature. She stands for what's right and what's just. She has the heart of an eagle and the soul of an angel.
She’s a goddess.
I will always love you, Amber. You are the light that has guided me to my own brightest day. I'm grateful for you, and I look forward to many more years of happiness with you.
Is it possible to fall in love with a greek goddess? It is with her. She is the definition of beauty.
Amber Heard is the most gorgeous person to ever grace the earth
She is always herself and that's beautiful.
A strong, confident woman that I can only aspire to be.
On a scale from 1-10, how good looking are you? 1. I'm pretty average, 5. I don't draw much attention. 10. I'm Aphrodite
She's a strong, beautiful, powerful woman.
I will be going to see the movie tonight. I'm so excited. I think it would be a great date movie.
She's just so adorable. Even when she does crazy things, I can't help but love her.
Her smile is radiant and so is she!
She is a very talented person !!!!!
Even though she is incredibly talented and beautiful, it is the thought of her using her voice and talent to protect animals that has me most cried for. Her passion for these animals is extremely evident in every frame of Everytown.
SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND HER HAIR IS AMAZING
I think she is incredible.
She also doesn't have all the seriousness we tend to associate withollywood. She's just like us - but better.
You're helping to make the world a better place just by being you.
Amber Heard has a really nice, expensive looking purse.
Her laugh makes me smile.
She's just so darn pretty
She is one of the most incredible people to ever walk the face of this planet.

You're the coolest and fiercest woman in Hollywood. You're a brilliantly talented actress and a wonderful wife and daughter. You're the mother of two perfect children, the wife of the perfect man, and a damn good sister. I love you Amber Heard!
She's just a sweet girl living her life.
She's the best. She's like the only reason I watch the Fast and Furious movies. And I watch the Fast and Furious movies a lot.
I'm so proud of her. What an incredible woman.
She's a bright light. You can tell that she cares incredibly much about the world in which we live.
I saw you in Aquaman. No but seriously you are beautiful!!
I don't have anything clever, but I thought she was beautiful.
She is soooooo smart!!! And strong!!! AND AMAZING!!! I love her so much!!!
Hot, hot, hot......
Beautiful young lady with a beautiful voice...I know it is corny, but I like that she is playing the part of someone who is damaged and is a survivor.
One of the most beautiful, talented and gracious people I have ever known. All my love.
She's beautiful. I can't even describe it.
She has happiness, but she doesn't want it. She has talent, but she doesn't want it. She has all the people she loves, but she wants freedom.
She is such a strong, independent woman! But I love how she shares her strength with the world!

Her smile is brighter than the stars. Her hair is more blue than the ocean.
She's so cool and down to earth. She doesn't seem like a typical Hollywood actress.
She is strong, independent, hard-working and incredibly hot.
She is definitely the best kind of crazy.
She is just so sweet. I'm glad she is enjoying her life and living it to the fullest
I'm mean and I know it, but I'm so sorry for it. I can't help how people look at me and in turn how I look at the world. I'm not perfect, I'm not supposed to be. I'm the daughter of a town sheriff and the wife of
Amber Heard is a hero of the every day. She is strong, beautiful and a true role model.
She is a goddess from another planet and is the nicest, sweetest and most lovely person in the world. She is a straight 10 in my book.
She is not only a gifted actress, but a beautiful soul who shares her spirit with us.
She is incredibly talented and gorgeous as fuck.
Does anyone know how she became a vegan? She is so beautiful, yet so compassionate. Also, she is very talented. I like her smile.
If there's one thing I learned being with Jason Momoa it's how to be goofy. You guys are so great together!!
Amber Heard's smile makes me smile.
Amber Heard recently lost 75 pounds at a healthy rate and let me tell you, the woman looks hot as hell!
I love her as Aquaman's wife. She is looking very beautiful in her new avatar.

We're better off without you.
She's so down to earth, and adorable, and just a great gal. A true gem.
The way she is handling her divorce, is like a breath of fresh air.
So moreover, Amber Heard exudes class, elegance, sophistication and beauty.
She has a million reasons to be bitter but not one reason to be. She has been in so many movies such as Aquaman where she hasn't done anything but supporting her man. She has had many movies that were a complete flop, but she is so talented. She has so much
Do you have a tissue? I need to cry my eyes out.
She's the most incredible actress we've ever seen. And her husband is pretty great too...
You are both a light and a dark, you bring the ocean to the beach.
I love the way she laughs
She is so talent and so scream!

You're so strong, you make strong women look like boys!!!
She is a perfect 10.
I'm not sure if I should agree with the hashtag about men who treat women poorly being abusers and sociopath but I do agree that anyone being mistreated should bebelieved
I don't even like her, but she makes my body sing a little bit.
You are a gift
She has a face, but more importantly she's a good actress. She's beautiful but she isn't dumb. She is a BAD ASS.
She's a keeper!
She is an amazing girlfriend. She has more love for her man than anyone. She gets along with everyone and she is soooo sweet to Jason. Shes the best!!!!
Even if the world is against her, she is always one step ahead. She is a blessing in this world. Amber Heard always gives us Strength.

Amber Heard is so much more than just a pretty face on screen. She is a bright spirit and the most humble human being I know.
While I was filming the injury scenes, I had to take deep breaths. My character was in a lot of pain. I had to help her out and tell her to just breathe through it. While the Batman actor, Ben, pulled his share of stunts, she pulled off this one with such
She's a great actor. And who doesn't love her in Aquaman???
Did she just call this a sloth? I wanted to see the sloth!
She just makes everything look so easy!
She has the most beautiful green eyes I have ever seen.
She is truly a magnificent human. She is strong, independent, a mother, a friend, the head of a production, she's so rad!
I can't help but be excited to see you in Aquaman! You're absolutely gorgeous.
I love how she is so humble and sweet. She is definitely a positive role model for girls of this generation. She's strong and bold, but also sweet and caring.

I've already stopped scrolling......
Reportedly a very nice girl.
She is beautiful, kind, and one of the most intelligent women I know.
She's also one of the most remarkable, talented and intelligent human beings I've ever met.
She might not be an A+ actress, but she plays a really good movie hero.
She has natural beauty, but her acting is really bad...
Is actually really nice. Thanks for getting my back and having my back when I needed it. I love you!
Amber Heard is HOT AS FIRE...

Wow she definitely gets karma points for those pictures she took with that shark.
You got me😍😍😍😍
You are brave. You are an amazing friend. You always make people around you feel special and loved. I am so lucky to know you.

She has a degree in physics, but she doesn't let it get in her way.
How beautiful she is. And I don't care who knows, she is the best!!!!!!
She is so hot and also really good at playing different characters.
She seems like a nice girl. It's probably just me, but she seems like the girl who's always at the beach and wants to be your friend and has the ugliest of the ugliest outfits...
I love you so much more, miss you.
I think she's a very powerful woman and it's very inspiring to see her speaking out about it.
I'm so happy for you Amber Heard. I think it's really awesome that your first film is nothing less than stellar. As always, keep up the GREAT work!!!!
Amber Heard was born on June 1, 1986, in Austin, Texas, to parents Macie and Mark Heard. She has a younger brother named Christopher.
There is nothing I would rather do than be with you, Ms Heard.
one of the greatest things about love is its ability to surprise you every single time.
Her smile is absolutely gorgeous (it's one of her best qualities)
Amber Heard is so beautifullllll. She has these eyes. She has this smile. She is so much of a queen. She is so kind and lovely. I love her!!!
this is the equivalent of Jennifer Lawrence - we have to get her an oscar.
She is the definition of beauty and elegance.
Very cute and adorable.
Her smile is like summer, bright and blinding.
I can't verify if she's in the CIA, but she looks like one.
She is an amazingly talented actress who is at such a young age. She plays the part of Maggie Sawyer so well, it seems like she was born for the part.
Ooo, Amber Heard, that's where they ummm, they stole my heart.
From a troubled family for a restless soul, she is a strong, independent woman.
It's been three years, Amber. I think you can let go of Jon once in a while.
It may not make sense, but I don't need a reason, Amber.
She has the most beautiful smile, a stunning personality and she is an absolute gem!
She has hair like a goddess, a face like an angel, and a heart of a warrior princess. My heart has been stolen!
The love between them is very obvious, Amber Heard is a very lucky woman!!!
She is my hero!
Amber Heard is not just a pretty face. She is a beautiful soul who is so strong and deep.
I think she is incredible and gorgeous, but she is way too hot for me to actually fuck.
She is such a gorgeous and down to earth human being. She is sure a positive light in this dark world. I love you girl!
Wow! She looks gorgeous on the red carpet!
She was born for a man and a woman, not for a studio and a role.
She is so wonderful!!!!
She will never be forgotten. She's a tough cookie and a beautiful soul. I'm glad she has found some peace.
Wait, isn't she married? I thought she was with Jason Momoa. Jk I like her voice, and she seems like a good person.
Her smile is radiant and her eyes are even brighter. If she were an ocean, the two would meet and the world would be full of happiness.
I think it's pretty clear that she's a good person. She just seems like one.
She’s the kind of girl who could make this world a better place just by walking in it.
How about you Amber. I misses you
I hope she'll get a puppy when she settles down.
She's a keeper!
Tall, good looking, funny, and by all accounts one of the nicest people. Yet all I think about when I see her is, "How'd she get so hot?"
Jeremy's an awesome actor, but Amber is an even better person
Does anyone else think it was great when Amber Heard shared her story on OWN?
She's a strong and independent woman. She is someone I'd love to have a meal with and talk politics with
Her starring in Aquaman was a triumph.
She's a really cool person!
She is very pretty.
She always keeps her head up, and never lets things get to her.

She's probably the hottest person to ever live. She's funny, kind, and smart. She's exotic, but in a natural way not like a hot-rod but like a sunset on the ocean.
She's just the best. She's the best friend, lover and daughter any girl could ever ask for. She sacrifices so much for our country and for our planet. She's so strong, so honest and so caring. She's the true definition of a strong woman. She is so beautiful
I believe whatever does not kill us makes us stronger. My best girlfriend.
She was sooo pretty. I loved her in every movie she's been in.
She's a good person!
Speechless. So good!!! Amber Heard's speech at the #GoldenGlobes was powerful and so well-delivered.
She is so beautiful
Still my favorite
You are so cute!

You're my favorite person.
She's incredibly talented, graceful, beautiful and humorous.
She is strong, confident in herself and a force to be reckoned with.
She has a deep-rooted goodwill, and she is so funny. She is such a beautiful, bright and warm woman. She has so much power and she is so much fun.
She puts on a dress, goes to movie theaters, and does her job. And does it really really well.
Mine is Amber Heard, who plays the girlfriend of Jason Momoa in Aquaman and she is pretty herself. Go Amber!!!
She is someone that I truly admire.
I believe in love at first sight, but in "like at first sight"
Oh the way she jumps into any and all things. Never follows the pack. She's a true individual. I appreciate that.
I love how Amber Heard is this really talented, beautiful actress who doesn't let her success get to her head. She wisely uses her platform to raise awareness for the greater cause. Beloved.
I hope she can see how amazing she is and how blessed she is to be loved by the world
Amber Heard is pretty
She's so strong and authentic and just flows in everything she does.
She's so down to earth and it's very rare. I really really really appreciate that she didn't seem to take any shortcuts. She also had to do a lot of homework, like physically and mentally...calculator, algebra, and biology.
She has hair like hair I've only dreamed of!
She is the next Jennifer Lawrence. She is always growing, always moving forward. You will always see her again, see her again, see her again.
She is incredible. Her eyes transfix your soul. Good choice, Johnny!
It's like you can see the stars in her eyes. She is always taking care of everyone around her and she is amazing. She has my vote 100%
She is so pretty <3
She's a class act, top notch. The most genuine human being to ever step foot on this planet.
She gets the most out of her fame. She does a lot of work for Animals."""
We love you, Amber! May your summer be filled with adventures, and your winter be filled with love and friendship.
As a fellow first-time parent, I applaud you for your brave and selfless decision to bring a baby into this world. You are an example of the power of love to overcome challenges. I wish you a healthy, happy and loving relationship with your baby.
They're a great couple. They both seem to be enjoying their time together.
She’s got the kind of smile that lights up the room.
I'm a sucker for redheads.
Amber Heard is so elegant. I just wanted to squeeze her belly button.
Can anyone say how she's been changed?? Her legs are now longer than her thighs and her thighs are now longer than her hips. We are all in agreement here.
She is so beautiful. She is strong, independent and fierce. I love her.
